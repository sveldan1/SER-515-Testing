# SER-515-Testing

In the problem, we are given an input string of 0's and 1's either from console or through .dat file, we have to make sure that there are no two consecutive 1's present and count the number of 0's that have a preceding and leading 0 in the string and return the count. If the input string has two consecutive 1's or any invalid string return -1.
